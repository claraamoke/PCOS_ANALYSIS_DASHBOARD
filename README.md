# PCOS_ANALYSIS_DASHBOARD
PCOS Analytics Dashboard- Data-Driven Risk Insights for Early Detection
This project explores real-world health data to build an interactive PCOS(POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME) diagonistic dashboard using Excel. 
it addresses the question: Can we identify women at highrisk of PCOS using non-invasive indicators like age, BMI, menstrual patterns, and follicle count?
The dashboard The dashboard delivers insights that can support early detection and awareness, especially in resource-constrained settings where advanced diagnostics may not be immediately available.

🧠 Key Features

✅ Interactive Dashboard with slicers for Age Group and BMI Category
📊 4–6 KPI Cards highlighting average BMI, age, testosterone level, PCOS % prevalence, etc.
📉 Visuals showing:
PCOS diagnosis by menstrual cycle pattern
Average follicle count by age group
BMI categories vs PCOS diagnosis
Chi-Square test showing statistical association between BMI and PCOS
Chi-Square test showing statistical association between menstural irregularity and PCOS

📈 Statistical calculations such as:
Averages
Proportions
Chi-square test and P-values

🔍 Key Insights
1 in 5 women in the dataset were diagnosed with PCOS.
Women with irregular periods and elevated BMI showed the highest risk.
High testosterone levels were strongly linked to irregular cycles.
The Chi-Square test revealed a statistically significant association between cycle irregularity and PCOS diagnosis.
Non-invasive features like BMI, age, cycle history, and follicle count can offer early warning signals.

🎯 Suggested Action
Build lightweight, data-driven screening tools that use menstrual patterns, BMI, and age as first-line filters to identify women at potential risk for PCOS — reducing delays in diagnosis.
